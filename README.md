# FingerSpellASL
This project focuses on developing an ASL (American Sign Language) translator that leverages machine learning and computer vision to bridge the communication gap between ASL users and non-ASL speakers. The system accurately recognizes ASL gestures and translates them into readable text, making communication more accessible and inclusive for all.
